    <h3>Amy Vance</h3>
    <p>My mother is from Northern Virginia and studied at UNC and Georgetown. She is now a successful nurse practitioner. She currently works in the town of Big Sky where she runs the mountain urgent care, attending to all injuries and sicknesses that occur on the mountain. In her free time, she loves hiking with the dogs, watching hockey, and trying out new restaurants.</p>
