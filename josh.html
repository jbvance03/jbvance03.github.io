    <p>My father is a software developer for a handful of businesses. Shortly after he studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Duke he went on to help launch Atlas rockets for NASA and the Air Force. My father has been a huge impact on not only my character, but my career and interest in flight.</p>
